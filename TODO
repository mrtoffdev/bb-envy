Toolkits to Develop:
1. Parallel
    File management system w/ full duplex synchronization for BB <---> Local

2. MCure
    Static program analysis tool to calculate RAM reqs & suggest alternatives

TODO LIST:
Fix me module defs bcoz it's become confusing

1. Build galahad
    Galahad is the Supervisor Module, i.e. the module that performs the ff.

        1. Build: Builds XAVT Config
            1. calls all modules necessary for Server Forensics
                Output includes:
                    - Schedule

            2. calls all modules necessary for Cluster Resource Allocation
        2. Deploy: calls Andromeda Module to deploy XAVT config
        3. Monitor: (Optional) calls all modules necessary for Server Resource Supervision
        4. Extend: (Optional) calls Eulrvisor for either global or server specific network operations

2. Build andromeda
    Andromeda is the Deployment Module, i.e. the module that performs the ff.

        1. Fetches deploy configurations from XAVT Config
        2. Sends the latest build of /lib/Axiom to each involved AVTC
        3. Sends a Schedule json file to each AVTC which includes the server's runtime configs
            A. Each schedule contains timings / durations of when to init each axiom and for how long
            B. JSON file also contains other details such as:
                1. How many clusters are expected to run
                2. Location of output files such as logs (if any)
                3. Date of last Axiom library sync
                4. Etc. (To be filled if necessary)

3. Build eulrvisor
    Eulrvisor is a Network Forensics Module that performs the ff.

        1.  Profiles the network and builds a graph w/ each node containing necessary data for
            other modules (Current build is generative, tail recursive, DFS based node builder)
        2.  Includes net ops submodules such as Critterscan for automated | semi automated net-infilt
